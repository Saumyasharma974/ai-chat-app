# ⚡ AI-Powered Real-Time Collaboration App

## 🧾 Overview

This project is a full-stack real-time collaboration and chat application built with the MERN stack. It enables users to create projects, invite collaborators, and communicate through a live chat interface. Integrated with Google Gemini for AI support, the app allows users to interact with AI by typing `@ai` in the chat. It also uses Redis for performance optimization and WebContainer to run code directly in the browser.
